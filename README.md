A library for run time JS types

Archiving cause my sole purpose of working with dependabot github actions and jest is fulfilled and also the goal of getting more familiar with webpack. I will not start working again until I feel the need.

Have a pleasant day!
(P.S starring this repo might help to get working on this again!)
